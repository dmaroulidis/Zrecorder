# Zrecorder 

A system that joins Zoom meetings, records them with OBS Studio and
uploads the resulting file to storage services. There are two ways
that system functions.

## First way (WIP)

The first way is specific to Windows. It consists of OBS Studio
profiles for the different kinds of meetings that you would like to
record, your browser which shall be used to open / join meetings on
teleconferencing services, and a batch script that ties everything
together.
